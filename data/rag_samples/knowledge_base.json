  "MLX is an array framework for machine learning on Apple Silicon, brought to you by Apple machine learning research.",
  "The Unified Memory architecture of M1/M2/M3 chips allows the CPU and GPU to share the same memory pool.",
  "Unlike CUDA, MLX uses lazy evaluation, meaning computations are only executed when the result is needed.",
  "LSTMs are recurrent neural networks capable of learning long-term dependencies, but they are sequential and hard to parallelize.",
  "Transformers use the attention mechanism to process input sequences in parallel, making them faster to train than RNNs.",
  "LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) freezes pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices.",
  "Quantization reduces the precision of model weights (e.g., from 16-bit to 4-bit) to save memory and increase speed.",
  "RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) combines an LLM with a retrieval system to provide up-to-date information.",
  "Vector databases store embeddings of text, allowing for semantic search based on meaning rather than keywords.",
  "Apple Silicon's Neural Engine is a specialized NPU designed for accelerating machine learning inference.",
  "MLX supports automatic differentiation, vectorization, and computation graph optimization.",
  "Fine-tuning allows you to adapt a pre-trained model to a specific task or dataset.",
  "Prompt engineering is the art of crafting inputs to guide an LLM to generate desired outputs.",
  "Zero-shot learning is the ability of a model to perform a task without seeing any examples during training.",
  "Few-shot learning involves providing a small number of examples to the model at inference time.",
  "Chain-of-thought prompting encourages the model to explain its reasoning step-by-step.",
  "Hallucination is when an LLM generates incorrect or nonsensical information confidently.",
  "Temperature is a hyperparameter that controls the randomness of the model's output.",
  "Top-k sampling limits the model's choice to the k most likely next tokens.",
  "Top-p (nucleus) sampling limits the choice to the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds p.",

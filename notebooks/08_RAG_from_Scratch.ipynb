    "\n",
    "**Q: Vector Search vs. Keyword Search?**\n",
    "A:\n",
    "*   **Vector (Semantic):** Finds \"meaning\". Query \"dog\" matches \"puppy\". Good for concepts.\n",
    "*   **Keyword (Lexical):** Finds exact matches. Query \"Error 503\" matches \"Error 503\". Good for specific IDs/names.\n",
    "*   **Hybrid:** The best systems use both (Reciprocal Rank Fusion).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I handle stale data?**\n",
    "A: That is the main advantage of RAG over Fine-Tuning. You just update the Vector Database (add/delete/update vectors). The LLM doesn't need to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What is \"Re-ranking\"?**\n",
    "A: Vector search is fast but approximate. A common pattern is to retrieve 50 documents using vectors, then use a slower, more accurate \"Cross-Encoder\" model to re-rank the top 50 and pick the best 5 for the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💭 Closing Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Future of Context Windows**\n",
    "As LLMs support larger contexts (1M+ tokens), do we still need RAG?\n",
    "*   **Yes:** For latency and cost. Reading 1M tokens takes time and money.\n",
    "*   **Yes:** For privacy. You don't want to send your entire database to the model for every query.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architectural Evolution:**\n",
    "RAG is evolving from \"Static Retrieval\" to \"Agentic Retrieval\"—where the LLM decides *what* to search for, *when* to search, and *how* to filter the results. You are building the foundation for these autonomous agents."
